    Take a look at the console. 👍
    <script>
        // start with strings, numbers and booleans
        let name = "Justin";
        let name2 = name;
        name2 = "Young";
        console.log("Strings:" + name, name2);

        let age = 34;
        let age2 = age;
        age2 = 22;
        console.log("Number:" + age, age2);

        let awake = true;
        let awake2 = awake;
        awake2 = false;
        console.log("Boolean:" + awake, awake2);

        // Let's say we have an array You might think we can just do something like this:
        const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

        // You might think we can just do something like this:
        const players2 = players;

        // however what happens when we update that array?
        players2[1] = "Justin";
        // now here is the problem!
        console.log("Arrays:");
        console.log(players, players2); // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
        // one way
        const players3 = players.slice(); 

        // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        const players4 = [].concat(players);

        // or use the new ES6 Spread
        const players5 = [...players];

        // another way
        const players6 = Array.from(players);

        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
        players3[0] = "Nathan";
        players4[1] = "Hannah";
        players5[2] = "Jesse";
        players6[3] = "Junior";
        console.log("Arrays copy:");
        console.log(players, players3, players4, players5, players6);


        // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object 
        const person = {
            name: 'Wes Bos',
            age: 80,
            favorites: {
                dessert: "ice cream",
                number: 22,
                color: "purple"

            }
        };

        // and think we make a copy:
        const person2 = person;
        person2.name = "Justin Young";
        console.log("Objects:");
        console.log(person, person2);

        // how do we take a copy instead?
        const person3 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 34 }); // pass in empty object, what you want to copy, and the change you want in new object.
        
        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
        // const person4 = { ...person }; // Not yet available.

        // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. So the following will alter original too
        person3.favorites.dessert = "pie";
        person3.favorites.number = 72;
        console.log("Objects 1-level copy:");
        console.log(person, person3);

        // lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it, due to possible performance negatives.
        // Or you can convert to JSON and back again like 
        const person5 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person)); // Converts object to string, copies, then converts json string back to object.
        person5.favorites.number = 2;
        person5.favorites.dessert = "pie a la mode";

        console.log("Objects deep copy:");
        console.log(person, person5);
